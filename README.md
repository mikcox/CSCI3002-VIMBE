CSCI3002-VIMBE
==============

May end up being the greatest multi-touch bartop interface ever designed.

Save all these files somewhere locally, then open up /examples/VIMBE_Prototype.html in an HTML5-ready browser (most good browsers won't have a problem).

Press the 'c' key to clear the canvas.
Press the 'm' key to toggle modes.
* Mode 1: Draws a cute little orbiting orange thing around your finger.  Multi-touch friendly.
* Mode 2: Draws a funky blue lineish/flower thing out from your finger.  Multi-touch friendly.

If you have a touchscreen device, it's a lot more fun, but it'll generally work sorta-okay with a regular mouse.
